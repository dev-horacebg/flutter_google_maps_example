# Flutter Maps Example

A quick example detailing how to use a Google Map in a Flutter app.

## What this app does

Puts a bunch of indicators on a map, centred around London.
Provides a means to change the `CameraPosition` to focus on one of a
defined list of landmarks across London.

## Who this is for

Anyone interested in using a [Google Map in a Flutter application](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/google_maps_flutter).

## Setup

If you want to run the app as-is, don't forget to change both of the `ApiKey` values in `AppDelegate.swift` and `main/AndroidManifest.xml`to use your own Google Maps API Key which you can get from [here](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/).
